I'm Chong Shen! I'm a computational physicist at the [University of Twente](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/) - where I solve physics problems with data.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on reconstructing turbulence with deep learning models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about transformers and NLP.
- 💬 Ask me about parallel computing and filter coffee ☕️.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a magician and a [Laughing Monk](http://www.clfph.com.au/what-is-in-a-lion-dance/#:~:text=The%20dai%20tou%20fut%20or,cheeky%20tricks%20on%20the%20lions.) in a lion dance performance (not at the same time!).
